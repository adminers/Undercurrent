 // Using the Swing GUI class, draw a green square in the middle of the window;
 press the mouse button to add points, and after adding the first point, measure the time it takes to draw the second point. If the number of points is less than 10, the point will not be drawn. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, check out the Rendezvous pattern or Wikipedia articles for more information.
